The Assignment:
In the spirit of tonight’s meeting…your mission for the next 7 days, should you choose to accept it, is this:

Build a counter web app using HTML, CSS, and JS. It should have a button and a displayed number (starting at 0). When you press the button, the displayed number should increment by one.
Looking forward to seeing the many different solutions!
